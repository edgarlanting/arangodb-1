  it has not changed.

## Changes from version 0.13.1 to 0.13.2

- Fixed potential error in database version check when running
  _Starter_ on docker.

## Changes from version 0.13.0 to 0.13.1

- Fixed dangling container used to check database version when running
  _Starter_ on docker.

## Changes from version 0.12.0 to 0.13.0

- Database upgrade procedure has changed.
  It is now much more automated and can be triggered using
  an `arangodb upgrade --starter.endpoint=...` command.
  See [Upgrading _Starter_ Deployments](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/stable/upgrading-starter.html)
  for details.
- Added `arangodb remove starter` command to remove a machine
  from a cluster in a controlled manor.
  See [ArangoDB Starter Removal Procedure](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/stable/administration-starter-removal.html)
  for details.
- Changed default value of `--server.storage-engine` from `mmfiles`
  to an empty string. For deployments using ArangoDB 3.3 or earlier
  the effective default is still `mmfiles`. For deployments using ArangoDB 3.4
  or higher, `rocksdb` is the default storage engine.

## Changes from version 0.11.3 to 0.12.0

- Starter now writes it log output to file, unless you set the `--log.file` option to `false`.
  In this change, a new logging component is used, that results in some changes in the
  way the log messages appear in the log output. Also coloring of the logs has been slightly
  changed.
  Other new command line options are `--log.console=<bool>` to enable/disable logging
  to the standard output and `--log.color=<bool>` to enable/disable coloring
  log output. By default log output is using color when there is a terminal attached
  to the standard input of the process and the OS is not Windows.
- Fixed `arangodb start` command. (#112)

## Changes from version 0.11.2 to 0.11.3

- Solved problem with agency supervision mode in database auto-upgrade API.

## Changes from version 0.11.1 to 0.11.2

- Solved problem connection to agency when using TLS & authentication.
- Changed TLS algorithm for `-ssl.auto-key` from RSA (2048 bits) to ECDSA (`P256` curve).
- Changed default ECDSA curve used by `arangodb create tls ...` from `P521` to `P256`.
- Log text showing the address the starter is listening on has been changed from "Listening on ..." to "ArangoDB Starter listening on ...".
- Solved problem where starter did not properly log a resilientsingle server ("Your resilient single server can now be accessed ...") when leadership challenge was still ongoing.

## Changes from version 0.11.0 to 0.11.1

- Fix port binding check when using `--starter.host`. It used to check against the `any` interface, now it checks against `--starter.host`.

## Changes from version 0.10.4 to 0.11.0

- For `activefailover` deployments, the message where to reach your database is now only shown for the current leader.
- Added SystemD example. See `examples/systemd/README.md`.
- Added `--log.dir` option to configure a custom directory to which all log files will be written.
- It is no longer allowed to use `log.file` as a passthrough option.
- Added `--starter.host` option, to bind the HTTP server to a specific network interface instead of the default `0.0.0.0`.
- Added `POST /database-auto-upgrade` support to perform a rolling upgrade of all servers (with single `--database.auto-upgrade` restart)
- Renamed mode option `resilientsingle` to `activefailover`. (`resilientsingle` is being supported as alias for a while)
- Added support for log file rotation for started server components.
- Added support for running datacenter to datacenter replication servers (`arangosync`) from the starter.
- Changed increment for TCP ports (used when running multiple starters on same machine (e.g `--starter.local`)) from 5 to 10.
  An increment of 10 is needed to run datacenter to datacenter replication servers.
  If you have an existing cluster that is using `--starter.local` and you also want to enable datacenter
  to datacenter replication, you must create a new cluster.
- Added support for environment variables to act as commandline arguments.
  E.g. `ARANGODB_STARTER_DATA_DIR=/tmp/foo arangodb` equals `arangodb --starter.data-dir=/tmp/foo`.

## Changes from version 0.10.3 to 0.10.4

- Using shard `http.Client` to reduce the number of used file descriptors.

## Changes from version 0.10.2 to 0.10.3

- Support building in a directory other than the source directory. Set `BUILDDIR` (#98).
- Testing a server instance now includes testing for the expected server role.
- On linux, also look for `arangod` in `/usr/local/sbin` (#93).
- Fixed potential for hang in starter behavior.

## Changes from version 0.10.1 to 0.10.2

- Starting with mode `resilientsingle` and `--starter.local` will no longer limit
  the number of single servers to 2.

## Changes from version 0.10.0 to 0.10.1

- Remove `server.threads` & `javascript.v8-contexts` from generated `arangod.conf` files.
  Both settings are nolonger needed.

## Changes from version 0.9.3 to 0.10.0

- Added support for `resilientsingle` mode. A configuration of 2 single servers that replicate and take over when needed.
- Removed `--cluster.my-local-info` option from commandline of `arangod` servers. It is obsolete.
- Fixed combination of `--starter.local` & `--cluster.agency-size=1` (do not use for production!)

## Changes from version 0.9.2 to 0.9.3

- Added `--version` option and `version` command to show version of the starter.

## Changes from version 0.9.1 to 0.9.2

- Added `--starter.disable-ipv6` option to cope with environments
  where IPv6 is actively disabled.

## Changes from version 0.9.0 to 0.9.1

- Update to go 1.9.0
- Fixed registration for callback (in agency) by unreachable local slaves.
- Fixed port allocation in case of using `--starter.address=127.0.0.1` with `--starter.local` (#79)

## Changes from version 0.8.2 to 0.9.0

- Added `--docker.imagePullPolicy` option
- Allow multiple `--starter.join` arguments.
- Fixed high CPU load (#75)

## Changes from version 0.8.1 to 0.8.2

- Avoid using port offsets when using different `--starter.port`s that cause no overlap of port ranges.
- Cluster configuration is updated to all starters at regular intervals after
  the starters have bootstrapped and reached a running state.
- After starters have bootstrapped, they elect a starter to be master over the cluster configuration.
  All changes (addition/removal) are forwarded to this master.
  When the master is gone for too long, a new master is elected.

## Changes from version 0.8.0 to 0.8.1

- Fixed cluster setup in case where starters use different `--starter.port`s (#68).
- The `--rocksdb.encryption-keyfile` is now passed through the database servers in the `arangod.conf` file (it was passed as command line argument before).
  If you use this setting in an existing cluster, make sure the manually add this setting to all `arangod.conf` files before restarting the starters.
- Added `--starter.debug-cluster` option that adds a trail of status codes to the log when starting servers. (intended mostly for internal testing)
- Made database image used in test configurable using `ARANGODB` make variable.
- Added `--docker.tty` option for controlling the TTY flag of started docker containers.
- In cluster mode the minimum agency size has been lowered to 1 (DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION).

## Changes from version 0.7.2 to 0.8.0

- Added `start` command to run starter in detached mode.
- Added `stop` command to stop a running starter using its HTTP API.

## Changes from version 0.6.0 to 0.7.0

- Added `--server.storage-engine` option, used to change the storage engine of the `arangod` instances (#48)
- Changed option naming scheme (see `arangodb --help` for all new names). Old names are still accepted.
- Renamed github repository from `github.com/arangodb-helper/ArangoDBStarter` to `github.com/arangodb-helper/arangodb`.
- When an `--ssl.keyfile` (or `--ssl.auto-key`) argument is given, the starter will serve it's API over TLS using the same certificate as the database server(s).
- Starter will detect the name of the docker container is it running in automatically (if running in docker and not set using `--docker.container`)
- Changed default master port from 4000 to 8528. That results in a coordinator/single server to be available on well known port 8529
- Added `--starter.mode=single` argument, used to start a single server database instead of a cluster (#28)
- Starter will check availability of TCP ports (both its own HTTP API & Arangod Servers) (#35)
